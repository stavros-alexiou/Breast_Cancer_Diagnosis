# ANN-for-Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis

By this work, we utilized established medical records and via several Artificial Neural Network Architectures and varied training algorithms we show the viability of each model and the potential of such records. The paper treats our efforts to map the medical data, the obtained good results, and offer an insight in Artificial Intelligence applications.
